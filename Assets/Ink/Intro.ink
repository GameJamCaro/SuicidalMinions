Hi!

The task here is to take care of these little minions marching around.

There are one or more buttons at the bottom of the screen.

Click on them to set the right mode to help your minions.

Every 10 seconds a minion becomes really sad.

I mean so sad, that it will die if you don't comfort it.

In this case you set comfort mode and click on the minion that needs your help.

I hope comforting your minions lightens up your mind too :)
