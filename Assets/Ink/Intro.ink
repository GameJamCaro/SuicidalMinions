Hi!

There are one or more buttons at the bottom of the screen.

Click on them to set the right mode to help your minions.

Every 10 seconds a minion becomes really sad.

In this case you set comfort mode and click on the minion that needs your help.

I hope helping your minions lightens up your mind too :)
